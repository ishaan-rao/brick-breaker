# Brick Breaker
Rendition of the classic arcade game, Brick Breaker.

## Run
Run the Game.java file as a Java Application to start the game.

## How to Play
Use the left and right arrows to move the paddle. The objective is to
destroy all of the bricks without losing all of your lives. A life is lost
if the ball hits the bottom wall.

### Additional Rules
The green bricks are super bricks, meaning they need to be hit 3 times to be destroyed, rather than once.
Once you reach a score of 25, the ball is transformed into a super ball. A super
ball does not bounce off of bricks, but rather continues its path through them.
